## 🚀 Implementation Notes

### Build Order Rationale:

1. Start with **Basics** (foundation)
2. Then **Manipulation** (builds on accessing)
3. Then **Object Methods** (tools for working with objects)
4. Then **Modern Features** (contemporary syntax)
5. Then **`this` Keyword** (crucial concept, needs solid foundation)
6. Then **Advanced** (complex topics like prototypes)
7. Finally **Classes** (culmination of all concepts)

### Testing Strategy:

- Test each exercise immediately after creation
- Verify validation logic catches common mistakes
- Check watchVariables display correctly
- Test hints provide useful guidance
- Verify all navigation links work
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Quality Checks:

- All exercises follow exact pattern from arrays modules
- Consistent difficulty progression
- Clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- Real-world relevant examples
- Proper error handling in validation
- No confusing or ambiguous instructions
