# 📊 Module 1: Basic Array Methods

Master essential JavaScript array manipulation methods.

## 📚 What's Covered

This training playground teaches the following array methods:

- **`.push()`** - Add elements to the end of an array
- **`.pop()`** - Remove the last element from an array
- **`.shift()`** - Remove the first element from an array
- **`.unshift()`** - Add elements to the beginning of an array
- **`.slice()`** - Create a new array from a portion of another (non-mutating)
- **`.splice()`** - Remove, replace, or add elements at any position

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Read through each exercise carefully
3. Write your code in the provided text area
4. Click "Run Exercise" to test your solution
5. Use the "Show Hint" button if you get stuck
6. Practice in the free playground at the bottom

## ✨ Features

Students can work at their own pace and get immediate feedback on their solutions.

## 🔧 Files for This Module

- `index.html` - Basic array methods training page
- `exercises.js` - Exercise definitions for basic methods
- `app.js` - Application logic for basic methods
- `README.md` - This file (covers all modules)

## 📚 Other Modules

- `loops.html` - Loops & Iteration training (15 exercises)
- `advanced-arrays.html` - Advanced Arrays training (17 exercises)
- `index-nav.html` - Hub page to navigate between all modules

## 🎨 Shared Resources

- `styles.css` - Beautiful, modern styling (shared by all modules)
- `loop-exercises.js` + `loops-app.js` - Loops module files
- `advanced-exercises.js` + `advanced-app.js` - Advanced module files

## 📖 Learning Path

1. Start with `.push()` and `.pop()` - They're the simplest
2. Move to `.shift()` and `.unshift()` - Similar but work on the beginning
3. Learn `.slice()` - Important concept of non-mutating methods
4. Master `.splice()` - The most powerful but complex method
5. Complete the challenge - Combine multiple methods

## 🎉 Next Steps

After completing these exercises, students should:

- Understand when to use each array method
- Know which methods modify the original array vs. create new ones
- Be comfortable combining multiple methods
- **Then proceed to Module 2 (Loops) and Module 3 (Advanced Arrays)**
