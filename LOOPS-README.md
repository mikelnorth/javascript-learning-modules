# 🔄 JavaScript Loops Training Playground

An interactive learning environment for mastering all JavaScript loop types.

## 📚 What's Covered

This training playground teaches the following loop types:

- **for loop** - Classic loop with counter, condition, and increment
- **for...in** - Iterate over object properties and array indices
- **for...of** - Iterate over array values directly (modern approach)
- **while** - Loop while a condition is true
- **do...while** - Execute at least once, then check condition

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `loops.html` in your web browser
2. Read through each exercise carefully

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read the examples** - They show exactly how each loop works
2. **Start with the starter code** - Focus on the loop logic
3. **No need for console.log()** - The system automatically displays your variables!
4. **Check the hints** - They provide guidance without giving away the answer
5. **Experiment** - Use the free playground to try different approaches

## 🔄 Loop Type Guide

### When to Use Each Loop:

**for loop:**

- You know exactly how many iterations you need
- You need access to the index
- Working with arrays and need both index and value

**for...in:**

- Iterating over object properties
- You need the keys/property names
- Generally avoid for arrays (use for...of instead)

**for...of:**

- Modern, clean way to iterate over array values
- You only need the values, not the indices
- Working with iterables (arrays, strings, sets, maps)

**while:**

- You don't know how many iterations needed
- Loop depends on a changing condition
- Processing until a specific state is reached

**do...while:**

- You need the code to run AT LEAST ONCE
- Similar to while, but guarantees first execution
- User input validation scenarios

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. Start with **for loop** exercises (1-3) - Most common and fundamental
2. Move to **for...in** (4-5) - Understand object iteration
3. Learn **for...of** (6-8) - Modern array iteration
4. Practice **while** loops (9-10) - Conditional iteration
5. Master **do...while** (11-12) - Guaranteed execution
6. Complete **challenges** (13-15) - Combine all loop types

## 🎉 After Completion

Students will be able to:

- Choose the appropriate loop type for any situation
- Iterate through arrays and objects efficiently
- Understand the differences between each loop type
- Avoid common loop pitfalls and infinite loops
- Write clean, readable iteration code
